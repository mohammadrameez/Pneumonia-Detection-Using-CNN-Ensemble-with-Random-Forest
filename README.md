## Project Overview
This project is designed to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images by leveraging both custom CNN models and pretrained models (VGG16, ResNet101, and Xception) to extract meaningful features. These features are then combined using a Random Forest ensemble to enhance accuracy and robustness. The model incorporates image preprocessing techniques such as data augmentation and normalization. The systemâ€™s performance was evaluated using key metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report, demonstrating excellent results. This project showcases the practical use of machine learning and ensemble techniques to create an automated diagnostic tool for reliable medical diagnosis.

## Published Research

ðŸ“„ This project is also published as a peer-reviewed research paper:

**"Pneumonia Detection Using Machine Learning Techniques"**  
Published in: *8th International Conference on I-SMAC (IoT in Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud), 2024*  
ðŸ”— [View on IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10714803)

The paper provides an in-depth explanation of the methodology, experiments, and results, highlighting the effectiveness of combining CNNs with ensemble learning for pneumonia detection.


## Dataset
The project utilizes the **Chest X-Ray Dataset**, which was collaboratively developed by researchers from Qatar University, the University of Dhaka, and their collaborators. This dataset contains labeled chest X-ray images categorized into three classes:

* **Normal**: Comprising **10,192 normal chest X-ray images** collected from multiple sources.
* **Lung Opacity (Non-COVID lung infection)**: Featuring **6,012 images** of lung opacity.
* **Viral Pneumonia**: Consisting of **1,345 viral pneumonia chest X-ray images**.

All images are in **Portable Network Graphics (PNG)** format with a resolution of **299x299 pixels**. You can download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database). This comprehensive dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers aiming to develop impactful solutions for lung infections.


## Data Exploration and Preprocessing  
- **Image Preprocessing:**  
  - Data Augmentation: Rotation, scaling, and translation to avoid overfitting.  
  - Normalization: Image pixel values were normalized to a [0, 1] range.  

- **Label Encoding and Splitting:**  
  - Labels were one-hot encoded for classification.  
  - The dataset was split into **80% training** and **20% testing** using stratified sampling to maintain class balance.


## Model Architecture

The project utilizes several CNN-based models, including:

- **Custom CNN Model**: Built from scratch with BatchNormalization, Conv2D, Pooling, and Dense layers.
- **Pretrained Models**:
  - **VGG16**
  - **ResNet101**
  - **Xception**

These pretrained models were used to extract features from the X-ray images, with their final layers modified to suit the binary classification task.

## Ensemble Approach  
An **ensemble model** was created by:  
- **Neural Network Averaging:** Predictions from the custom CNN, VGG16, ResNet101, and Xception were averaged.

- **Random Forest Classifier:**  
   - A Random Forest model was trained using features extracted from VGG16.  
   - Neural network predictions were combined with Random Forest predictions to form the final ensemble output.

This ensemble approach improved the accuracy and robustness of the predictions.
